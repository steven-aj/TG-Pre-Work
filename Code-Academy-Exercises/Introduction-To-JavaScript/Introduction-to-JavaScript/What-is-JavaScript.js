/*
  Javascript is a scripting language for browsers!

  There are two primary ways for computers to translate human-readable code into
  something the machine better understands.

  One involves writing the code and then compiling everything a single time into
  an executable file to be distributed for use.

  The other involves writing code that's translated during runtime without
  pre-compiling anything. This method is scripting, as scripts are written and
  used when needed. Just like a play-script!
