/*
  Conditional statements are blocks of code that allow us to assess the
  condition of a given value and operate based on that assessment.

  In real world settings, all objects have states they enter depending on
  conditions required for those states.

  For example, a windmill has two states: dormant and active.
  The state of the windmill at any given time will depend upon windy
  conditions.

  NO wind means windmill is 'dormant'
  Wind means windmill is 'active'
